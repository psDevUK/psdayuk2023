Slides for my talk on Powershell output

I used Marpit to design my presentation. So that is all in the .MD file here. I exported this presentation to HTML. All the images I had in the same folder, so just dot-sourced them. I have included the demonstration files I used, if there is anything I can help you with regarding this please let me know. Thanks
